# Hello!

I'm Min-Hui, .
I graduated from National Cheng-Chi University in 2012 with a bachlor degree in statistic.

I have worked in finance department for over 6 years at e-formula Technologies and Allianz Taiwan Life Insurance.
I currently work with the team at [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/), Harvard's introductory course in computer science, where I focus on teaching, curricular development, outreach, and software tools.
I'm also the instructor for [Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript) offered through edX, Harvard Extension School and Harvard Summer School.
I have previously worked with a number of other computer science classes, including CS51, Harvard's course on abstraction and design in computing, CS124, Harvard's introduction to algorithms, and CS100, Harvard's course on software engineering in the digital humanities.
Outside of computer science education, I've also been a software engineering intern at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com), a news executive and digital strategist at [The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com), and I've also worked for [3P Speech](https://www.3pspeech.com) and the [National Speech and Debate Association](https://www.speechanddebate.org). I'm interested in computation, language, and education.
